### Web analysis service Matomo
Our website uses Matomo, an open source software for statistical analysis of user access. It is not possible to infer a specific person because your IP address is anonymized immediately after processing and before it is saved. We host Matomo ourselves. An external service provider is not involved.

Matomo is used for the purpose of improving the quality of our website and its content. This tells us how the website is being used and enables us to continuously optimize our offer.

You can contradict to the storage and evaluation of this data by Matomo at any time. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie is permanently stored in your browser, which causes Matomo not to collect any data for storage and analysis. However, if you intentionally or unintentionally delete this cookie, the contradiction to data storage and analysis will also be cancelled. Cookies are only used to recognize your contradiction each time a page is accessed.

Alternatively, most modern browsers have a "Do Not Track" option that can be used to instruct websites not to track your activity. Matomo respects this option.
